        <h1 style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;font-size: 3rem;">What is HTML?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;font-size: 1.5rem;">HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_none_" style="text-decoration: none; color: blue;">w3c</a> the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.

        The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language.
        
        HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.
        Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).
        HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.</p>
        <h1 style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;font-size: 3rem;">How does it work?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;font-size: 1.5rem;">HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author — these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful graphical editor to create HTML pages.</p>
        <h1 style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;font-size: 3rem;">Is this going to take long?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;font-size: 1.5rem;">Well, it depends on what you want from it. Knowing HTML will take only a few days of reading and learning the codes for what you want. You can have the basics down in an hour. Once you know the tags you can create HTML pages.

            However, using HTML and designing good websites is a different story, which is why we try to do more than just teach you code here at HTML Source — we like to add in as much advice as possible too. Good website design is half skill and half talent, I reckon. Learning techniques and correct use of your tag knowledge will improve your work immensely, and a good understanding of general design and the audience you’re trying to reach will improve your website’s chances of success. Luckily, these things can be researched and understood, as long as you’re willing to work at it so you can output better websites.
            
            The range of skills you will learn as a result of running your own website is impressive. You’ll learn about aspects of graphic design, typography and computer programming. Your efficiency with computers in general increases.You’ll also learn about promotion and your writing will probably improve too, as you adapt to write for certain audiences.</p>
