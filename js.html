        <h1 style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;font-size: 3.2rem;margin-left: 1%;margin-right: 1%;">What is JavaScript?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;font-size: 1.2rem;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 10%;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

            The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
            
            Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
            
            In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
        
        HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.
        Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).
        HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.</p>
        <h1 style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;font-size: 3.2rem;margin-left: 1%;margin-right: 1%;">How does JavaScript work?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;font-size: 1.2rem;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 10%;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">JavaScript is what is called a Client-side Scripting Language. That means that it is a computer programming language that runs inside an Internet browser (a browser is also known as a Web client because it connects to a Web server to download pages).

            The way JavaScript works is interesting. Inside a normal Web page you place some JavaScript code (See How Web Pages Work for details on Web pages). When the browser loads the page, the browser has a built-in interpreter that reads the JavaScript code it finds in the page and runs it.</p>
        <h1 style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;font-size: 3.2rem;margin-left: 1%;margin-right: 1%;font-size: 2.5rem;">How long does it take to learn JavaScript?</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;font-size: 1.2rem;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 10%;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Most programmers will say that it will take at least 6-9 months to learn basic JavaScript and really be comfortable with it. Even then, you will still spend years gaining new skills and a deeper understanding of JavaScript, as well as many of the hundreds of other programming languages.</p>
