            <p style="margin-left: 10%;margin-right: 10%;">Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to be alone. I like country’s peace; I like the beautiful countryside. I like delicious food and awesome friends; I like good books and my religion. I like the land and nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh. I always have dreamt to join the army and to become a brave soldier even though I don't care if I join the Airforce, the Navy, or the normal military, I just want to become a soldier. I want to save the life of the innocents and remove all the evil in this world which is growing day by day and becoming more stronger. I also love to do parkour and crazy stunts and I am a very good football player and also a legendary goalkeeper. I am quiet most of the time and I love to do good well now I hope you can have a rough picture of me, my character, and <strong>Who I Really Am.</strong></p>
